    "Q1: Difference between t-test and z-test:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both t-test and z-test are hypothesis tests used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. However, they differ in the scenarios for which they are appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "t-test: The t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown, or the sample size is small (typically n < 30). It assumes that the data follow a normal distribution. The t-test uses the t-distribution to calculate critical values and p-values.\n",
    "Example scenario: You want to compare the mean test scores of two groups of students, where the sample sizes are small, and the population standard deviations are not known.\n",
    "\n",
    "z-test: The z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or the sample size is large (typically n ≥ 30). It also assumes that the data follow a normal distribution. The z-test uses the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) to calculate critical values and p-values.\n",
    "Example scenario: You want to test the claim that the average height of a population is 65 inches, and you have a large sample size with known population standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: One-tailed vs. two-tailed tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "One-tailed test: In a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is directional and predicts an effect or difference in one specific direction. It is used when researchers have a specific expectation about the outcome and are interested in knowing if the effect is larger or smaller than a certain value.\n",
    "Example: A researcher predicts that a new drug will improve test scores, and the one-tailed test is used to determine if the scores are significantly higher after taking the drug.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-tailed test: In a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is non-directional, and it predicts a difference or effect in either direction. It is used when researchers are interested in knowing if there is a significant difference, but they do not have a specific expectation about the direction.\n",
    "Example: A researcher wants to test if there is a significant difference in reaction times between two groups, but they are not sure which group will be faster or slower, so they use a two-tailed test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 1 error (False Positive): It occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is true, but it is incorrectly rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis (Ha). In other words, the test incorrectly detects a significant effect that does not exist. The probability of a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha (α) and is the chosen significance level of the test.\n",
    "Example: A medical test incorrectly indicates that a healthy person has a disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error (False Negative): It occurs when the null hypothesis (H0) is false, but it is incorrectly not rejected, and the alternative hypothesis (Ha) is not accepted. In other words, the test fails to detect a significant effect that actually exists. The probability of a Type 2 error is denoted by beta (β).\n",
    "Example: A medical test fails to detect a disease in a person who actually has the disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: Bayes's Theorem with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes's Theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that calculates the probability of an event happening based on prior knowledge or evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for Bayes's Theorem is:\n",
    "P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A happening given that event B has occurred.\n",
    "P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B happening given that event A has occurred.\n",
    "P(A) is the probability of event A happening.\n",
    "P(B) is the probability of event B happening.\n",
    "Example: Consider a medical test for a rare disease, where the test correctly identifies the disease 95% of the time (P(positive test|disease) = 0.95), and the probability of a person having the disease is 0.01 (P(disease) = 0.01). Calculate the probability that a person actually has the disease if they test positive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution:\n",
    "P(disease|positive test) = (P(positive test|disease) * P(disease)) / P(positive test)\n",
    "P(disease|positive test) = (0.95 * 0.01) / P(positive test)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since P(positive test) can be calculated as the sum of the probabilities of a positive test in disease and non-disease cases:\n",
    "P(positive test) = P(positive test|disease) * P(disease) + P(positive test|no disease) * P(no disease)\n",
    "P(positive test) = (0.95 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, substitute this value back into the Bayes's Theorem equation:\n",
    "P(disease|positive test) = (0.95 * 0.01) / [(0.95 * 0.01) + (0.05 * 0.99)]\n",
    "P(disease|positive test) = 0.16\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the probability that a person actually has the disease given a positive test result is 0.16 or 16%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Confidence interval and its calculation with an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A confidence interval is a range of values within which a population parameter (e.g., mean, proportion) is likely to lie, along with a chosen level of confidence. It is used to quantify the uncertainty associated with estimating a population parameter from a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Let's calculate the 95% confidence interval for the population mean weight of a certain product based on a sample of weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a sample of 100 product weights with a sample mean (x̄) of 45 pounds and a sample standard deviation (s) of 3 pounds.\n",

    "Interpretation: We are 95% confident that the true population mean weight of the product lies within the range of (43.08, 46.92) pounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Using Bayes' Theorem to calculate probability with prior knowledge and new evidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider a scenario with a deck of cards. You know that the deck contains 10 red cards, 15 blue cards, and 5 green cards. Now, you draw one card randomly, and you want to calculate the probability that the card is blue given the prior knowledge of the card's color distribution.\n",
    "\n",

    "Copy code\n",
    "# Prior probabilities (P(A)): Probability of each color\n",

    "\n",
    "Q8: Margin of error in a confidence interval and its relation to sample size:\n",
    "\n",
    "The margin of error is the range of values added to and subtracted from the point estimate to create the confidence interval. It represents the uncertainty associated with estimating a population parameter based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the margin of error in a confidence interval is:\n",
    "Margin of Error = Critical Value * Standard Error\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical value depends on the chosen confidence level and the distribution used (e.g., z-critical value for the z-distribution, t-critical value for the t-distribution).\n",
    "The standard error depends on the sample standard deviation and sample size.\n",
    "As the sample size increases:\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard error decreases, which means the estimate becomes more precise.\n",
    "The critical value remains constant for a given confidence level.\n",
    "Therefore, a larger sample size results in a smaller margin of error, indicating a more accurate estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Suppose you want to estimate the average age of students at a university. With a small sample size, your margin of error may be large, and the confidence interval may be wide, making the estimate less precise. However, with a larger sample size, your margin of error would decrease, resulting in a more precise estimate of the average age.\n",
